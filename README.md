# NeTravel

### Description
NeTravel is a  simulation of an expert system that allows users to find their most desired travel destination.

### Installation
You need a local server to run this. I have used [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) v 7.2.12.
```sh
1 Download and install XAMPP --works on Linux, Windows and MacOS
2 Open up XAMPP and start Apache and MySql servers.
3 Place the website content in the root directory --create a folder in 'XAMPP\htdocs'
4 Open up MySql database.
5 Import the script found in the 'database script' folder from the repo.
6 Navigate to the specific folder path -in the browser- using the 'localhost' root url.
```
